These are phrases and words that signal a question is being asked, even if it doesn't end with a question mark.\n\n**Direct Question Words (The \"WH\" Words and \"How\"):**\n\n*   **Who:**  Asks about a person or people.\n*   **What:** Asks about a thing, idea, or action.\n*   **Where:** Asks about a location or place.\n*   **When:** Asks about a time or date.\n*   **Why:** Asks about a reason or cause.\n*   **Which:** Asks about a choice from a set of options.\n*   **Whose:** Asks about possession or ownership.\n*   **Whom:** (Formal) Asks about the object of a verb or preposition (the person receiving the action).\n*   **How:** Asks about the manner, method, or condition.\n\n**Auxiliary/Helping Verbs at the Beginning of a Sentence:**\n\nThese often indicate a yes/no question:\n\n*   **Do/Does/Did:**  \"Do you like pizza?\"\n*   **Is/Am/Are/Was/Were:** \"Is it raining?\"\n*   **Have/Has/Had:** \"Have you seen my keys?\"\n*   **Can/Could:** \"Can you help me?\"\n*   **Will/Would:** \"Will you be there?\"\n*   **Shall/Should:** \"Shall we go?\"\n*   **May/Might:** \"May I borrow your pen?\"\n*   **Must:** \"Must we leave now?\"\n\n**Phrases that Introduce Questions:**\n\n*   **Can you tell me...**\n*   **Could you explain...**\n*   **I'd like to know...**\n*   **I was wondering...**\n*   **Do you know...**\n*   **Would you mind telling me...**\n*   **Is there any chance...**\n*   **I'm curious about...**\n*   **What's the deal with...** (Informal)\n*   **What's up with...** (Informal)\n*   **How come...** (Informal, similar to \"why\")\n*   **Mind if I ask...**\n\n**Intonation and Context:**\n\n*   **Rising intonation:**  Sometimes, a statement can become a question simply by raising the pitch of your voice at the end. Example: \"You're going to the store?\"\n*   **Context:** The surrounding conversation or situation can make it clear that a question is being asked, even without explicit question words.\n\n**Tag Questions:**\n\nThese are short questions added to the end of a statement:\n\n*   **..., isn't it?**\n*   **..., aren't you?**\n*   **..., do you?**\n*   **..., can't we?**\n*   **..., will they?**\n\n**Embedded Questions:**\n\nThese are questions within a larger sentence:\n\n*   \"I don't know **where he went**.\"\n*   \"She asked **if I was coming**.\"\n*   \"Can you tell me **what time it is**?\"\n\n**Rhetorical Questions:**\n\nThese are questions asked for effect, not to get an answer:\n\n*   \"Isn't that just great?\"\n*   \"Who doesn't love a good mystery?\"\n*   \"How could anyone do such a thing?\"\n\nThis list covers most of the common question callouts.
