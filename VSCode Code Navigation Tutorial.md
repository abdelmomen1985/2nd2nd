Visual Studio Code (VSCode) offers powerful code navigation features that can significantly boost your productivity. This tutorial will guide you through some of the most useful navigation techniques.

## 1. Go to Definition (F12)

- Place your cursor on a symbol (variable, function, class, etc.)
- Press F12 or right-click and select "Go to Definition"
- This will take you to where the symbol is defined

## 2. Peek Definition (Alt+F12)

- Similar to Go to Definition, but opens the definition in an inline window
- Useful for quick checks without leaving your current context

## 3. Go to Line (Ctrl+G)

- Press Ctrl+G
- Enter the line number you want to go to

## 4. File Navigation (Ctrl+P)

- Press Ctrl+P to open the Quick Open dialog
- Start typing the name of the file you want to open
- Use arrow keys to select and Enter to open

## 5. Symbol Navigation (Ctrl+Shift+O)

- Press Ctrl+Shift+O to see all symbols in the current file
- Type to filter the list
- Great for navigating large files

## 6. Workspace Symbol Search (Ctrl+T)

- Similar to symbol navigation, but searches across all files in the workspace

## 7. Breadcrumbs

- Look at the top of the editor for the breadcrumbs bar
- Click on any part of the path to jump to that level of code structure

## 8. Go Back / Forward

- Use Alt+Left to go back to your previous location
- Use Alt+Right to go forward

## 9. Reference Search (Shift+F12)

- Find all references to a symbol in your codebase

## 10. Outline View

- Open the Outline view in the File Explorer sidebar
- This shows the structure of your current file for easy navigation

Remember, you can customize these keybindings in VSCode's Keyboard Shortcuts menu if you prefer different shortcuts.

Practice these techniques regularly, and you'll find yourself navigating code much more efficiently in no time!
