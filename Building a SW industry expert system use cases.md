> create a usecase for building a SW industry expert system, start by asking me the most important 10 yet simple question about this usecase

I'm excited to help you craft a use case for building a software (SW) industry expert system! To ensure we create a solid foundation, I’ll start by asking you 10 simple yet critical questions to shape the use case. Your answers will guide us toward a tailored and practical solution. Let’s dive in:

1. **What is the primary goal of this expert system?** (e.g., improving decision-making, automating tasks, providing recommendations)  
2. **Who are the main users of this system?** (e.g., developers, project managers, QA engineers, executives)  
3. **What specific area of the software industry should it focus on?** (e.g., development, testing, deployment, maintenance)  
4. **What kind of knowledge or expertise should the system provide?** (e.g., coding best practices, debugging techniques, industry standards)  
5. **What problems or challenges in the software industry are you aiming to solve with this system?**  
6. **How should the system deliver its expertise?** (e.g., text-based advice, step-by-step guides, interactive Q&A)  
7. **What data or inputs will the system need to function effectively?** (e.g., code snippets, project requirements, error logs)  
8. **Are there any specific technologies or tools it should integrate with?** (e.g., GitHub, Jira, CI/CD pipelines)  
9. **How will success be measured for this expert system?** (e.g., time saved, error reduction, user satisfaction)  
10. **Are there any constraints or limitations to consider?** (e.g., budget, time, technical expertise of users)

Please feel free to answer these as briefly or as detailed as you’d like! Once you provide your input, I’ll weave it into a concise and actionable use case for your SW industry expert system.

Thank you for your detailed answers! Based on your input, I’ve crafted a use case for building a Software (SW) Industry Expert System tailored to your needs. Here it is:
### Use Case: Software Industry Expert System for Custom Development Agency

#### Overview
The expert system is designed to enhance decision-making and streamline project delivery within a custom software development agency. It targets executives and project managers (PMs), empowering them to overcome ambiguity, satisfy clients, and deliver projects faster with improved usability—all while working within the constraints of limited developer experience and time.

#### Goals
- **Primary Objective**: Improve decision-making and accelerate project delivery by providing actionable insights and guidance.
- **Focus Area**: Custom software development agency operations, emphasizing usability and speed.

#### Target Users
- **Executives**: Leverage the system to oversee project health, allocate resources effectively, and ensure client satisfaction.
- **Project Managers (PMs)**: Use the system to clarify requirements, reduce ambiguity, and guide teams toward faster, client-aligned delivery.

#### Problem Statement
Custom development projects often face challenges such as unclear client requirements, ambiguous decision points, and delays due to limited developer experience. These issues lead to increased costs, dissatisfied clients, and missed deadlines. The expert system aims to address these by providing structured guidance and proactive interventions.

#### Functionality
- **Knowledge Domain**: The system will offer expertise in improving usability (e.g., user-centric design principles) and speeding up delivery (e.g., prioritization techniques, efficient workflows).
- **Delivery Mechanism**:
  - **Guides**: Step-by-step recommendations for common project scenarios (e.g., refining vague requirements).
  - **Rules**: Predefined best practices and decision-making frameworks (e.g., when to escalate issues).
  - **Agentic AI**: An intelligent agent that analyzes inputs and intervenes with suggestions during key project phases (e.g., flagging risks in real-time).
- **Inputs**:
  - Project documentation (e.g., scope, timelines).
  - Analysis and requirements (e.g., client briefs).
  - Meeting transcripts (e.g., discussions with clients or teams).
- **Integrations**:
  - **GitHub**: Pulls code progress and developer activity for real-time insights.
  - **ClickUp**: Syncs with task management to align recommendations with project workflows.

#### Success Metrics
- **Cost Reduction**: Decrease in project overruns and resource waste (e.g., fewer revisions).
- **Client Satisfaction**: Higher client approval rates and positive feedback on delivered solutions.

#### Constraints
- **Limited Developer Experience**: The system must simplify complex guidance to be actionable for less-experienced developers.
- **Time**: Recommendations and interventions must be quick to implement, respecting tight project schedules.

#### Example Scenario
A PM uploads a client’s vague project brief and a meeting transcript to the system. The agentic AI analyzes the inputs, identifies ambiguous requirements (e.g., "user-friendly interface"), and suggests specific usability questions to clarify with the client. It then generates a guide for prioritizing tasks in ClickUp and flags potential risks based on GitHub activity (e.g., delayed commits). The executive reviews the system’s summary, approves the refined plan, and tracks a 20% cost decrease due to fewer late-stage changes.

#### Benefits
- Reduces ambiguity by translating client needs into clear, actionable steps.
- Speeds up delivery through optimized workflows and proactive risk management.
- Satisfies clients with usable, high-quality deliverables, boosting agency reputation.
